# June blueprint

Living brainstorm notes. Not a finished plan. Goal: shape an engineer prompt.

Updated: 2026-08-11

> Brain dump. Grow freely. Honk = flaw exhibit, not a product requirement.

## Thesis (Daniel)

June is a **new, independent core for building cross-platform agentic UI**, distributed like shadcn: copy-pastable, composable source primitives. It should be able to **replace Honk Core** (`@honk/core`) as a drop-in host for Core+Clients products. It is not a Honk fork.

Not "the chat product." Not "just an agent loop."

Emphasis on **UI**. People already build harnesses and agent systems; what is missing is a good way to build the UI layer on top. Pi is not there yet for a full product system. OpenCode v2 is WIP but its SDK shape is the one we like.

Flue-like posture:

- deploy the core to the cloud if you want
- embed in a website (streaming / AI-SDK-like client experience) if you want
- most importantly: give builders the primitives they actually need in the core to build everything else

Especially target **GUI apps**. Flue already covers cloud + React web. The gap is a desktop / Cursor-class client built on shared primitives.

It is a harness in the sense of **primitives that help you build a harness**, aimed at GUI.

### Non-negotiable demos

1. Mimic Cursor UI
2. Cloud agent UI demo
3. Our own GUI client
4. Quick start: shadcn chat component on June Core
5. Longer arc: demos that prove recreate-all (Cursor / Linear / Notion / OpenCode / Pi shapes)

## How the refs layer (important)

```
Pi          = agent engine / harness primitives (Flue is built ON Pi)
Flue        = framework to define agents + deploy (Node/CF) + web SDK/React
OpenCode v2 = local headless server + typed client SDK that TUI/desktop/IDE all talk to
Linear post = product boundaries (skills, tool design, mid-run approvals)
```

June sits closest to: **OpenCode's "server + UI clients" split**, with **Pi/Flue-grade durable conversation core**, and **Linear-grade progressive capability loading**, aimed first at **GUI**.

---

## Cursor: what actually goes to the server

(Correcting "if core is in the cloud you lose local access.")

There are two Cursor modes. Do not mix them.

### A) In-IDE Agent / Chat (local tools)

Documented / widely reverse-engineered flow:

1. Electron UI captures message + @mentions + rules + open file context
2. Request goes to **Cursor servers** (auth, prompt assembly, sometimes embedding search)
3. Codebase index: embeddings + obfuscated path/line metadata in Turbopuffer; **source stays local**
4. Server returns hit metadata; **IDE reads real files locally** and injects snippets into the prompt
5. Cursor proxies the composed prompt to the LLM provider; streams tokens back
6. Chat history persists in local SQLite (`state.vscdb`), not as the system of record on Cursor servers
7. **Tool execution (read/edit/terminal) runs client-side** in the IDE

So for in-IDE Cursor: the "brain call" is remote, but **local access is preserved because the tool loop and file reads stay on the machine**. Hosting the model/proxy in the cloud does not by itself remove local FS access.

- https://theaiengineer.substack.com/p/how-cursor-actually-works
- https://cursor.com/blog/cloud-agent-environment

### B) Cloud Agents (remote VM)

Different product surface. Agent runs on a Cursor-managed (or pool) VM with a checkout of the repo. It does **not** see your unsaved buffer / arbitrary local disk the way the IDE agent does. It sees the remote workspace. Local vs cloud is a **runtime placement** choice, not "LLM must be local."

### Implication for June

Daniel's instinct is half right:

- If the **entire agent runtime** (tools + FS + shell) lives only in the cloud, you lose the local machine.
- If the **core is a protocol + session brain** and **tools are bound to a local host** (OpenCode-style local server, or IDE host), you can put model calls / orchestration wherever and still know what exists locally.

June should probably make **host placement** explicit:

| Piece | Can be local | Can be cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GUI client | yes | (web) |
| Session / conversation store | yes | yes |
| Model calls | via proxy | via proxy |
| Tools / FS / shell | bound to a host | bound to a VM |

The interesting product is: same UI primitives against a local host **or** a cloud host.

---

## Feature comparison (draft — filling as research lands)

### OpenCode (SDK / server shape we like)

Architecture: `opencode` starts a **headless HTTP server** (OpenAPI 3.1). TUI, desktop app, and IDE plugins are **clients**. `opencode serve` for standalone. SDK: `@opencode-ai/sdk` with `createOpencode()` (spawns server+client) or `createOpencodeClient({ baseUrl })`. Events over SSE.

Surfaces: terminal TUI, desktop app (beta), IDE extension, web.

Agents: built-in `build` (full access), `plan` (read-only / permissioned), `general` subagent (`@general`).

#### Server / SDK API surface (from docs)

Global: health, global events
App: log, list agents
Project: list, current
Path / VCS: current path, vcs info
Config: get/patch, providers
Provider: list, oauth authorize/callback
Sessions: list/create/get/delete/update, children, init (AGENTS.md), fork, abort, share/unshare, diff, summarize, revert/unrevert, permissions respond, status, todos
Messages: list/get, prompt (sync), prompt_async, command, shell; parts-based messages; structured output via json_schema
Files: find text/files/symbols, read, status, list
Tools (experimental): tool ids, tool schemas per model
LSP / formatters / MCP: status; add MCP dynamically
TUI control: append prompt, open dialogs, submit/clear, execute command, toast, control next/response
Auth: set provider credentials
Events: SSE bus (`event.subscribe`)

Also: undo/redo in product UX, share conversations, themes, keybinds, custom commands, formatters, multi-provider (models.dev), Zen curated models, privacy claim (does not store your code/context).

WIP note: v2 branch exists; SDK v2 codegen under `packages/sdk/js/src/v2`; product still evolving; desktop is beta.

**UI lesson:** the core value for June is the **client/server cut**: GUI never embeds the loop; it speaks a typed protocol to a host that owns tools + sessions.

### Flue (Astro team's agent framework; built on Pi)

Hooks API (`'use agent'`, `useModel`, `useSandbox`, …). Targets: Node, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions / CI. Vite + Hono app router. `createAgentRouter` mounts conversation URLs.

Capabilities (docs map): agents, models/providers (via Pi), tools, skills, sandboxes (incl. Cloudflare Computer durable workspace, Cloudflare Containers sandbox), routing, deploy (Node/CF), CLI (`flue init`, `flue run`, `flue add`), Agent SDK (`@flue/sdk`), React (`@flue/react` / `useFlueAgent`), streaming protocol (SSE + Durable Streams), attachments, abort, history/observe/wait/read.

Client model: **one client = one conversation URL** (mount path + conversation id). No deployment-wide enumerate-conversations API — app concern. Sends are 202 admissions; settlement via streams.

React: parts-based messages (`text`, `reasoning`, `dynamic-tool`, `file`); optimistic user messages; not AI SDK types/transport.

**UI lesson:** excellent for **web** product UX on a **deployed** agent. Weaker as a story for a **local desktop Cursor-class** host (that's OpenCode's cut). Flue + Pi give durable cloud conversations; OpenCode gives local tool host + multi-client.

### Pi (earendil-works/pi)

Identities: coding agent tool, learning textbook, SDK.

Packages: `pi-ai` (multi-provider LLM), `pi-agent-core` (agent loop), `pi-coding-agent` (CLI product + SDK), `pi-tui` (orthogonal TUI), experimental `pi-orchestrator`.

Default tools: read/write/edit/bash (+ grep/find/ls). Modes: interactive, print/JSON, RPC, SDK. Extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, Pi packages. Tree/DAG sessions, fork, YOLO-by-default, 30+ providers, tiny system prompt.

**AgentHarness** (packages/agent/docs/harness.md) — durable runtime:

- Session = entry tree + facts + lanes + usage ledger
- Storage = entries (write-once) + registers (mutable) + usage (append)
- Operations with total `op.state` program counter; crash resume
- Effect sandwich: intent commit → uncertain effect → settlement commit
- Lanes for parallel threads over shared history (e.g. Slack)
- Hooks, telemetry, search over session entries
- Build order + invariants documented

Explicit non-goals in product philosophy: baked-in MCP, subagents, permission modals, plan mode, background bash, built-in todos (prefer extensions / files / containers).

**UI lesson:** strongest **durable harness** thinking. Weakest **product UI kit**. pi-tui is terminal-only; no first-class GUI protocol like OpenCode's OpenAPI server.

### Linear Agent (product patterns, not a framework)

System prompt = style + hard boundaries + product taxonomy + default opinions.
Constraints preferably in **tool design**, not prompt prose.
Large number of shallow product tools vs coding agent's few deep tools.
**System skills** = progressive disclosure of prompt fragment + tools.
Custom harness needs: dynamic tool injection (cache-aware), conditional mid-run approval, async sub-agents that suspend parent.

**UI lesson:** GUI must represent permissions, skill-loaded capability changes, and multi-surface tone. The core should emit events a UI can render (approval cards, tool parts, status).

---

## Comparison matrix (coarse)

| Concern | Pi | Flue | OpenCode | June target? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Durable session / crash resume | Harness spec strong | Durable streams / DO | Sessions + server; less formal than Pi harness | Steal Pi model |
| Local tool host (FS/shell/LSP) | CLI/SDK local | Sandboxes (often remote/CF) | First-class local server | Must |
| Cloud deploy | DIY | First-class | Secondary | Optional same protocol |
| Typed client SDK for UI | Weak / RPC | `@flue/sdk` + React | `@opencode-ai/sdk` + OpenAPI | Must (OpenCode-shaped) |
| Web chat UI | No | React hooks excellent | Web exists; desktop/TUI primary | Demo |
| Desktop / Cursor-like GUI | No | No | Desktop beta | **Primary demo** |
| Progressive skills | Skills/extensions | Skills | Agents/commands/MCP | Yes (Linear-style events) |
| Mid-run approvals | Extension territory | App-level | Permissions API in server | First-class UI events |
| Parts-based messages | Messages/events | Flue parts | Message + Part types | Shared part model |
| Multi-client same session | RPC/modes | observe() many clients | TUI + IDE + desktop on one server | Must |

## Working design bets (challenge these)

1. June core = **host protocol** (session, messages/parts, tools, permissions, events) + **pluggable runtimes** (local machine host, cloud VM host, maybe Flue/CF later).
2. GUI is a **peer client**, never the loop.
3. Demos prove the cut: same core drives Cursor-like desktop UI and a cloud-agent UI.
4. Handwritten end to end. Cite refs for lessons only; no wrapping their harness.

---

## Open questions for Daniel

1. Is the v1 host **always local** (OpenCode-like), with cloud host as demo #2, or dual from day one?
2. Message/part schema: align with OpenCode Parts, Flue parts, or define June parts and adapt?
3. ~~embed/reuse Pi~~ **Decided: handwritten.** How thin is the first harness slice?
4. AuthN for GUI ↔ host: local default trust, then token for remote?
5. What does "mimic Cursor UI" mean minimally: chat + diff + file tree + to-dos + permissions, or pixel-level?

## Draft engineer prompt

(still empty — fill after we talk through the bets and demos)


---

## Flue deep inventory (research pass)

Source: flueframework.com + github.com/withastro/flue (Apache-2.0). Flue is built on Pi. Flue 2.0 = hooks-based dynamic agents; Vite owns build; conversation-scoped `@flue/sdk` + `@flue/react`.

### Positioning
Programmable harness framework (sessions, tools, skills, instructions, sandbox). Headless by design. Write once → CLI or deploy Node / Cloudflare / CI.

### Agent model
- `'use agent'` function; return value = system instructions; re-renders before every model call
- Addressable instances by id
- Statics: agentName, initialData schema, durability (maxAttempts, timeoutMs)
- Dynamic caps from persistent state

### Hooks (16 built-in)
useModel, useSandbox, useTool, useMcpConnection, useSkill, useSubagent, useInstruction, usePersistentState, useInitialData, useDelivery, useDispatchMessage, useDataWriter, useAgentStart/Finish, useResponseStart/Finish

### Tools
defineTool/useTool (Valibot), sandbox builtins (read/write/edit/bash/grep/glob), framework tools (task, activate_skill, read_skill_resource), harness tools, durable tools via step.do

### Skills
Agent Skills SKILL.md; progressive disclosure; workspace `.agents/skills/`

### Subagents
useSubagent / GeneralSubagent; fresh child context; parallel task; depth cap 4; durable child streams

### Sandboxes
None | Virtual (just-bash) | Local Node | Remote adapters (CF Computer, CF Sandbox, Daytona, E2B, Modal, Vercel, boxd, exe.dev, islo, Mirage, smolvm…)

### Durability
Admit → durable stream before model work; queue; resume; abort; recovery of partials/tool batches. Node: lease + db.ts. CF: DO SQLite.

### HTTP / streaming
POST /:id → 202; history; updates (SSE or long-poll); abort; attachments. Own protocol (not Vercel AI SDK). Parts: text, reasoning, dynamic-tool, file, data-*.

### UI
@flue/sdk = one conversation URL. @flue/react = useFlueAgent. No first-party desktop/IDE shell. No built-in session list/search/delete (app routes).

### Also
Channels (Slack, Discord, GitHub, Linear, …), many Node DB adapters, OTel/Braintrust/Sentry, blueprints via `flue add`, no workflow primitive.

### Gap vs June demos
Excellent cloud + web embed backend. Missing Cursor-class desktop shell, open-folder workspace UX, productized approvals UI, multi-pane IDE chrome. June owns that shell; Flue is the closest "foundation + deploy + stream" reference.


---

## OpenCode v2 deep inventory (research pass)

**Critical:** Stable docs at opencode.ai/docs/sdk describe **V1** `@opencode-ai/sdk`. Daniel's preferred shape is **V2** on branch `v2` / site https://v2.opencode.ai:

- `@opencode-ai/sdk-next` — in-process Effect host (same HTTP router, no listener)
- `@opencode-ai/client` — Promise + Effect clients codegen from Protocol
- `@opencode-ai/protocol` + `schema` + `server` + `core`
- Binary: `opencode2` / `@opencode-ai/cli@next`
- Law: Client → Schema/Protocol only; never Core/Server. sdk-next may compose all three.

### Architecture bet
All UIs are thin clients of one HttpApi. TUI, desktop, web, Promise client, Effect client, in-process embed share handlers/middleware/errors.

### Session semantics (the interesting cut)
Durable **admit** → **pending inbox** → promote at safe boundary → process-local **drain**. Delivery: `steer` / `queue`. Also: interrupt, compact, staged revert (stage/clear/commit), fork, switchAgent/Model, context projections, instructions as typed hashed values, SSE event log.

### Other V2 surfaces
Location (project-scoped service map) · Permissions (ordered rules + ask/allow/deny + saved + session reply) · Tools (unified + MCP + CodeMode) · Forms/Questions · PTY/Shell/VCS · Plugins · Subagents/jobs · Providers/models.dev

### Built-in tools
read, write, edit, patch, glob, grep, shell, question, skill, subagent, webfetch, websearch, file-diff (+ MCP)

### UI packages (why this matters for June)
- `@opencode-ai/ui` + `./v2/*` design system
- `@opencode-ai/session-ui` + `./v2/*` transcript/diff/prompt
- `@opencode-ai/app` SolidJS web/desktop shell
- `@opencode-ai/tui`, `@opencode-ai/desktop`

### WIP
sdk-next transitional; clustering/workspace placement reserved; no exactly-once hard-crash claim; sharing unimplemented; Desktop may still lag engine; dual clients in TUI; public stable docs still V1.

### June steal list from OpenCode v2
1. One protocol, many clients (incl. embedded = same router)
2. Admit/pending/steer/queue/interrupt vocabulary (not a boolean isRunning)
3. Permissions + questions as first-class session APIs a GUI can bind
4. session-ui / ui v2 as reference for Cursor-like chrome (or inspiration, not necessarily dependency)
5. Location = workspace service scope, not ambient cwd

---

## Pi deep inventory (research pass)

Packages @earendil-works/* ~0.84.x. MIT. Mario Zechner / Earendil.

### Layers
pi-ai → pi-agent-core (Agent + AgentHarness) → pi-coding-agent (CLI/SDK) · pi-tui (orthogonal) · experimental pi-protocol/client/server (CBOR) · pi-telemetry · sqlite session backend · pi-evals

### Product features
Modes: interactive / print / JSON / RPC / SDK. Tools: read/write/edit/bash (+ grep/find/ls). Tree sessions, fork, compact, share gist, AGENTS.md, skills, extensions (hot-reload), themes, packages (`pi install`). YOLO default. 30+ providers. Mid-session model switch.

### AgentHarness (durable)
Session = entry tree + facts + lanes + usage. Three stores. Effect sandwich. Total op.state program counter. Lanes for parallel threads. Hooks + events. Search. Telemetry schemas. Crash resume without replaying settled effects.

### Explicit non-goals in core
MCP, subagents, permission popups, plan mode, built-in todos, background bash, FS permission product — all extension/container territory.

### Gaps for Cursor-like GUI
No first-party GUI/IDE, no LSP/index, no multi-file apply UX, no MCP marketplace, no permission product, no cloud sync. RPC + SDK production-ready; CBOR remote protocol experimental. Two session stacks coexist (coding-agent JSONL v3 vs harness format-4/SQLite).

### June steal list from Pi (ideas only — handwritten)
1. Durability model ideas (lanes, ops, effect sandwich)
2. Minimal core + extension levers
3. Clear GUI integration seams
4. Do not expect a TUI harness to be the Cursor shell

---

## Cursor deep pass (official + community)

Confirmed hybrid:

| Mode | Brain | Tools | Sees dirty local disk? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In-IDE Agent | Cursor cloud | Your machine | Yes |
| Managed Cloud Agent | Cursor cloud | Cursor VM (git clone) | No |
| My Machines / pool | Cursor cloud | Your worker | On that worker |

Official: even BYOK still goes through Cursor backend for final prompt building. Indexing = Merkle sync + server embeddings + metadata; client reads bytes. Privacy Mode ≠ local LLM. Cloud Agents are the main feature that stores repo copies for a duration.

**June vocabulary:** cloud brain ≠ blind to local. Blindness comes from choosing a **remote tool host**. Prefer naming **tool host placement** explicitly (local | cloud VM | my machine).

---

## Synthesis for engineer prompt (still drafting)

June delivers:

1. **Host protocol** inspired by OpenCode v2 (HttpApi-shaped, admit/pending/events/permissions/parts)
2. **Durable session/ops** inspired by Pi's *ideas* (handwritten; not their package)
3. **Deploy/embed story** inspired by Flue (conversation streams, optional cloud target) without requiring Flue
4. **GUI demos:** Cursor-like desktop client + cloud-agent UI, both speaking the same protocol to different tool hosts



---

## Daniel notes (2026-08-11 evening)

OpenCode having a real **core** + **desktop app** is good. That is why we looked at it and used it once.

Gaps we care about vs that core:

- Not durable / configurable enough in the Pi sense
- Customizing the system prompt is **easy in Pi**, **hard in OpenCode's new core**
- We want Pi-level steerability (SYSTEM.md / append / resources / hermetic config) without giving up OpenCode's client/server + GUI kit

### Honk as lived experiment (`~/Developer/honk`)

Honk already ran this A/B in production code:

| When | Move |
| --- | --- |
| Mid-2026 | Core rewrite cutover (ADR 0011): multi-harness Core (pi / Claude / Cursor), HTTP+SSE SDK, desktop host |
| ~Jul 29 | OpenCode-only cutover (`replace Core v1 with OpenCode SDK`, `OpenCode-only cutover`) — sidecar / packages/opencode era |
| **Aug 11, 2026** | **`cut over chat, composer, and runtime off OpenCode`** → owned chat stack on **Pi AgentHarness** host (`@honk/core`) |

Current `spec/core.md` thesis (working draft):

1. One host process, one writer lease
2. Every session contains a real Pi `AgentHarness` (do not copy session model into a second Honk model)
3. Workspace trust is the **only** permission gate (YOLO after trust)
4. Clients reload Pi session data and render messages themselves
5. Host keeps running across UI reloads

Honk Core does **not** depend on `pi-coding-agent` / `pi-tui`. It constructs `AgentHarness` with `systemPrompt`, tools, resources, models, JSONL repo.

What Honk still steals from OpenCode (even after leaving it):

- Message snapshots / per-turn git checkpoints (refs/honk/checkpoints/…)
- Per-file restore grain for undo
- Websearch tool design notes
- Earlier: "part opencode, part t3code" multi-harness idea (ADR 0006) — later simplified toward Pi-native

Why Pi hermetic config mattered (ADR 0017, historical): Honk runs Pi under `HONK_HOME/harness/pi`, not `~/.pi/agent`, so user Pi extensions/settings cannot fight Honk or execute unowned code in-process. Project AGENTS.md/skills still load from cwd.

### Lesson for June

The OpenCode **shape** (core host + desktop/web clients + typed protocol) is right.
The OpenCode **configurability / durability / prompt ownership** is why Honk bounced back to Pi.

June should aim for:

- OpenCode-like: core process, desktop GUI, multi-client protocol
- Pi-like: AgentHarness durability, trivial system prompt / resources / skills ownership, hermetic but user-overridable config surfaces
- From the Honk flaw exhibit: do not maintain two session models; trust gate once; handwritten harness; steal OpenCode checkpoint *ideas*



---

## Independence + Honk replaceability (Daniel, continued)

June is a **new, fully independent** project. Not a Honk fork. Not a rename.

Success criterion for the core: **easily replace `@honk/core`**. Honk (or anything with that Core+Clients shape) should be able to swap its host for June Core without rewriting the product chrome from scratch.

Implications:

- Stable, boring client protocol (session CRUD, prompt/steer/queue/interrupt, reload/entries, events, permissions/trust, models)
- Pi-grade prompt/config ownership (system prompt, resources, skills) as first-class, not buried
- OpenCode-grade multi-client host (desktop/web/CLI attach to one core)
- No Honk-specific product names required in the core; Honk becomes one consumer

### Demo section (non-negotiable + quick starts)

1. **Cursor-like UI** (main GUI demo)
2. **Cloud agent UI** demo
3. **Own GUI client**
4. **Quick start:** shadcn chat component wired to June Core (lowest-friction "see it work" path for web before the full Cursor shell)



---

## Distribution philosophy (Daniel): feel like shadcn

Everything is **copy-pastable and composable**.

Not "install `@june/sdk` and call a black box." More like:

- registry / CLI that drops source into *your* repo
- small primitives you own after paste (host bits, protocol client, chat chrome, tool parts)
- compose a Core, a web chat, a desktop shell, a cloud-agent UI from the same pieces
- defaults that work; every layer replaceable without forking the universe

Tension to manage (write it down, don't paper over it):

- Honk-replaceability wants a **stable protocol contract**
- shadcn-feel wants **owned source**, not a versioned binary API forever

Resolution bet: the **wire protocol + part schema** are the stable contract; the **React/desktop implementations** are registry code you copy. Core reference implementation can be a package *and* a template you can eject.

Demos should teach composition:

1. `june add chat` → shadcn chat pieces + thin client against a local Core
2. `june add desktop-shell` → Cursor-like chrome composed from session-ui primitives
3. `june add cloud-host` → same client, different tool host



---

## Harness inside the core (Daniel)

There **is** a harness inside the Core. It must stay **simple like Pi**.

Rules of thumb:

- Small tool set by default; extend, don't bloat
- System prompt / resources / skills are obvious and user-owned (Pi-easy, not OpenCode-hard)
- Durable session ops without a second competing session model
- Product features (plan mode, MCP marketplace, approval theater) are composed *around* the harness, not welded into it
- If a knobs list needs a glossary, it failed the Pi test

The Core wraps the harness (lease, trust, HTTP, clients). The harness itself stays a steerable shell.

**Handwritten:** this harness is June's code, not an imported Pi/OpenCode/Flue runtime.



---

## How to read this file (Daniel)

This blueprint is a **brain dump**. It can keep growing. Do not optimize for short.

Honk is **not** a customer June must satisfy. It is a demonstration of how a core (ours / prior attempts) develops flaws: OpenCode cutover, dual models, prompt ownership pain, bounce back to Pi. Use it as a cautionary exhibit, then move on.



---

## Hard rule: handwritten

**Everything is handwritten.** June does not reuse or wrap another project's harness (not Pi AgentHarness, not OpenCode core, not Flue runtime) as the implementation.

References are for **ideas and critique only**:

- steal vocabulary / lessons (admit/pending, effect sandwich, parts, client/server cut)
- do not `import` their harness as June's brain
- do not say "sit on Pi" or "embed OpenCode" in the engineer prompt

June Core + June harness are authored in this repo (and/or copy-pasted out via the registry), end to end.



---

## Recreate-all test (Daniel)

Demos teach what the core needs. A **good core can recreate**:

| Product | What it is (for this test) | What it forces the core to support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pi** | Minimal coding agent / steerable shell | Tiny tools, obvious system prompt + resources/skills, tree/fork sessions, steer/follow-up, YOLO-or-container posture, multi-provider |
| **OpenCode** | Local core + many clients (TUI/desktop/IDE) | Headless host, typed multi-client protocol, parts/events, permissions/questions UI hooks, project Location, PTY/shell, MCP |
| **Cursor** | IDE agent + cloud agents | Local tool host + dirty workspace awareness; cloud tool host (VM) with same client protocol; diffs/checkpoints; retrieval/context assembly; subagents; rules/skills as files |
| **Linear Agent** | Product agent in Linear/Slack | Many shallow product tools; progressive skills; mid-run approvals; dynamic tool injection; surface-aware tone; durable runs that pause for humans |
| **Notion Agent** | Workspace agent + Custom Agents | Domain tools over pages/DBs (not just files); @-context / source selection; connector tools (Slack/Mail/Calendar/MCP); **identity & ACL** (agent sees what user/agent is allowed); **triggers/schedules** for autonomous runs; run logs / reversible actions; instructions + skills personalization |

### Core capability checklist (union of the above)

If June Core is "good," handwritten support for these exists (UI chrome can be demo/registry):

1. **Host process** clients attach to (local and optionally remote)
2. **Sessions** with prompt / steer / queue / interrupt / abort
3. **Parts + events** a GUI can render (text, reasoning, tools, questions, markers…)
4. **System prompt + instructions + skills** ownership that is trivial to customize
5. **Tool registry** deep (FS/shell) *and* shallow (product CRUD) tools
6. **Progressive skills** (load capability packs without stuffing every turn)
7. **Decision / trust signals** on the wire if needed (events the UI can bind) — **not** permission/disclosure UI (out of scope)
8. **Workspace / Location** scope (cwd or workspace id, not ambient global)
9. **Identity & ACL** for product agents (Notion/Linear-shaped)
10. **Triggers & schedules** for autonomous Custom-Agent-shaped runs
11. **Checkpoints / revert** for coding-agent-shaped undo
12. **Multi-client** same session (desktop + web + mobile observe)
13. **Pluggable tool host placement** (this machine vs cloud VM)
14. **Connectors / MCP** as tool sources without baking one product's ontology in

### Implication

Demos are not side quests. Each demo proves a slice of that checklist.

- shadcn chat → 1–4, 12
- Cursor-like UI → 1–8, 11–13
- cloud agent UI → 13 (+ same protocol)
- Linear-shaped demo → 5–7, 9, progressive skills
- Notion-shaped demo → 5, 9–10, connectors
- Pi-shaped CLI/TUI → 2–5, simplicity litmus

The core is still the product. The recreate-all set is how we know the core is complete enough.

## Core vs UI scope (Daniel)

Not everything in the recreate-all products belongs in June Core.

**UI-side (out of core scope):**
- Permission / approval **chrome** (cards, modals, disclosure UX)
- Progressive disclosure **presentation** (how skills/tools are shown/hidden in the UI)
- Tone / surface styling (Slack vs app chat look)
- Most Cursor-like IDE chrome (file tree layout, pixel mimic)
- Chat hooks / scrollers / bubbles (shadcn, AI SDK UI territory)

**Core-side (in scope):**
- Harness + host + sessions + parts/events + tools + prompt/skills ownership + triggers + ACL **data**
- Approval **policy** and pause/resume (can a tool run yet?) — not the card
- Protocol surface so UI can bind decisions/catalogs/status
- Do **not** ship productized permission theater UI inside the core

Litmus: if it's pixels or copy for humans deciding, it's UI. If it's durable state / tool execution / wake conditions / what the model can call, it's core.

## AI SDK v7 as scope referee (2026-08-11)

Ref: https://vercel.com/changelog/ai-sdk-7 · https://ai-sdk.dev/v7/docs/getting-started/navigating-the-library · https://ai-sdk.dev/v7/docs/agents/tool-approvals

v7 library split:

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| **AI SDK Core** (`ai`) | models, tools, `ToolLoopAgent`, `toolApproval` **policy**, `WorkflowAgent` durability, `runtimeContext` / `toolsContext`, `instructions`, sandboxes, harness adapters, telemetry |
| **AI SDK UI** (`@ai-sdk/react` …) | `useChat`, transports (`DirectChatTransport` / HTTP), rendering `UIMessage` parts, MCP App iframe renderer, approval **response** helpers in the chat hook |

Message split: `ModelMessage` = model context; `UIMessage` = parts for painting (text, reasoning, tools, files, data, approval states).

### Answer for June core vs UI

| Concern | June Core | June UI / registry demos |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Permission / disclosure **chrome** | no | yes |
| Approval **policy** + pause before tool runs | yes (v7 `toolApproval`-shaped) | no |
| Progressive disclosure **presentation** | no (may expose catalogs) | yes |
| Parts / stream protocol | yes | consumes |
| Chat scroller / bubbles / Cursor shell | no | yes |
| Instructions / skills ownership | yes | configures via protocol |
| Triggers / ACL data / tool host placement | yes | configures / displays |

Litmus aligned with v7: **pixels and human prompts = UI**; **loop, tools, policies, durable state, wire parts = core**.

## Why not "just AI SDK" (Daniel's experience)

Question: why doesn't OpenCode just use AI SDK? Why do `sdk.session` / project / path / file feel local in a way AI SDK never delivered?

### Different layers

| | **AI SDK (v7)** | **OpenCode SDK/server** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shape | Library in *your* process / request | Long-lived **local host** + typed client |
| Session | App-managed `UIMessage[]` (or opaque harness resume if wrapping) | First-class server objects: create/list/fork/abort/revert/share |
| Workspace | You define tools; no built-in dirty-disk host API | Project/path/file/find/symbols/VCS/shell bound to the machine |
| Clients | Typically one `useChat` ↔ one transport | Many clients ↔ one core (TUI/desktop/IDE/script) |
| Loop | `ToolLoopAgent` / `streamText` | Host runs the agent against that workspace |
| Honesty check | v7 adds `HarnessAgent` **adapters for OpenCode/Pi** | Proves AI SDK alone wasn't enough |

AI SDK docs (harnesses): a harness owns workspace, built-in tools, native session state, compaction, permissions — larger than a model call. Chat routes must **resume session**, not replay full UI history into the model.

### What Daniel felt

`sdk.session` / workspace-shaped APIs are **local host control planes**. AI SDK gave streaming chat + tool loops; it did not give a durable, attachable, multi-client coding host over the files on disk.

### June takeaway

- Steal OpenCode's **host + session + workspace protocol** idea (handwritten).
- AI SDK may help **UI demos** or model plumbing later; it is not a substitute for June Core.
- Do not design June as "useChat + tools" and hope workspace falls out.

## Building-block / Lego core (Daniel)

Refs:
- https://github.com/lucia-auth/lucia — auth as small clean primitives + adapters
- https://github.com/pilcrowonpaper/arctic — OAuth clients as swappable provider blocks
- https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-block-economy — ship high-quality blocks; let others (and agents) glue quantity on top

### Posture

June Core is **blocks all the way** — no privileged framework kernel other pieces hang off. Session, parts, host, store, log, providers, tools: each is a block. You compose them.

- swap **runtime host** (local Node, Cloudflare, …)
- swap **logging / telemetry**
- swap **model providers**
- swap **storage** (memory, JSONL, SQLite, DO, …)
- swap **tool packs** (FS/shell vs product CRUD)
- session / parts / protocol are blocks too — not a hidden baseplate

Syntax inspiration (Lucia/Arctic): small functions, explicit adapters, no hidden global framework magic. User composes:

```ts
// sketch only — not an API promise
const core = createJune({
  store: sqliteStore(path),
  host: localHost({ cwd }),
  log: pinoLogger(),
  providers: [anthropic, openai],
  tools: [fsTools, gitTools],
});
```

Cloudflare is one block (`host` / `store`), not a fork of June.

### Fit with shadcn distribution

- Blocks are copy-pastable **or** tiny packages — either way, user owns the composition site
- Registry demos show recommended assemblies (chat, desktop shell, cloud host)
- Agents glue blocks well when docs are sharp (Hashimoto's point)

### Fit with handwritten rule

We handwrite the blocks. We do not wrap Pi/OpenCode as the composition. Their *ideas* inform the shapes of the blocks.

---

## Package layout (OpenCode naming)

Daniel preference: follow **OpenCode v2 package names**, not invent (`parts` / `agent` / `host-local`). Scope `@june/*`. Handwritten blocks still; names match the shape we like.

OpenCode v2 packages we care about (from `anomalyco/opencode` `v2`):
`schema`, `protocol`, `core`, `server`, `client`, `sdk-next`, `ai`, `util`, `plugin`, then UI later (`ui`, `session-ui`, `app`, `desktop`, `cli`, `tui`).

Law to keep (OpenCode): clients talk **schema/protocol** only — never import `core` / `server` internals.

### v0 packages (first cut)

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `@june/schema` | Parts, messages, events, shared types |
| `@june/protocol` | Host API surface (session, permissions, events) |
| `@june/core` | Session + loop + composition (`createJune`-style wiring lives here as blocks, not a sealed kernel) |
| `@june/server` | Local HTTP host binding |
| `@june/client` | Typed client for UIs |
| `@june/ai` | Model provider adapters |
| `@june/util` | Tiny shared helpers |

### Later (same names as OpenCode when we need them)

`sdk` / `sdk-next`, `plugin`, `ui`, `session-ui`, `app`, `desktop`, `cli` — Cloudflare/host variants stay composition inside `server`/`core` (or a thin adapter package), not a rename away from this map.

### Explicit non-names for June packages

Do not ship `@june/parts`, `@june/agent`, `@june/store`, `@june/host-local` as top-level packages unless we later decide OpenCode's map is wrong. Store/log/host swaps are **adapters composed into** `core`/`server`, Lucia-style.

### Decision (2026-08-12)

Lock package names to OpenCode map. `@june/core` is the name (not `agent-core`). Inside `core`: Pi-simple harness — obvious system prompt / resources / skills, pluggable session backend. Steal Pi's session-backend idea as composition into `core`/`server`, keep OpenCode's `schema` / `protocol` / `server` / `client` / `ai` / `util` names.

## Multi-client protocol (Daniel, 2026-08-12)

OpenCode2's server shape is efficient because **clients do not force a rewrite of the API per language**. One host speaks a stable protocol; TUI / desktop / IDE / web all attach as clients.

June takes that further as a hard goal: the same protocol must be implementable from **any** client language/runtime — including a **Swift iOS/macOS app** — not only TypeScript. Typed TS client is first-party; Swift (and others) are first-class citizens of the wire, not afterthoughts.

Implications:
- **Protocol + schema are the product surface** clients bind to (OpenCode law: clients talk schema/protocol, not core internals)
- Prefer language-neutral wire (OpenAPI / HTTP+SSE or equivalent) over TS-only RPC tricks that do not codegen cleanly
- `@june/client` is the TS SDK; mobile/native apps use generated or hand-written clients against the same protocol
- Do not bake React/TS UI assumptions into the host API

## Local box workspace notes (2026-08-12)

Daniel's sidekick (June) keeps a working copy of this repo on the shared computer at `~/Developer/june`.

Tooling installed there for on-the-fly work:
- **Ghostty** as the terminal
- **VSCodium** (`codium`) as the editor (pure OSS VS Code)
- **mise**: Node 24 + pnpm 11 (see `mise.toml`)
- CLIs on PATH: `claude` (Claude Code), `codex` (OpenAI), `pi` (earendil-works), `agent` / `cursor-agent` (Cursor CLI)
- Codex CLI signed in on that machine

GitHub CLI device login was rate-limited on the box; prefer authenticating `gh` with a token or committing from Daniel's Mac when the desktop app is connected.

Package cut remains OpenCode-named (`@june/schema|protocol|core|server|client|ai|util`) with Pi-simple harness inside `core`, multi-client wire including Swift.

## Linear Agent as complexity stress-test (2026-08-12)

Refs:
- https://linear.app/now/how-we-built-linear-agent
- https://linear.app/docs/linear-agent

Linear Agent is a useful **complexity stress-test** for June: many UIs, one agent, product ontology, progressive skills, durable mid-run orchestration, ACL-scoped action. **Do not build Linear in v0.** Ensure core blocks can recreate this shape later.

### Product surfaces (many UIs, one agent)

One agent behind many entry points:
- dedicated chat (multi-tab, history)
- `@mention` in comments / descriptions
- Slack, Teams, mobile
- coding sessions (delegate implementation)

Tone and guidance can differ per surface — e.g. Slack issue-creation guidance is separate from in-app workspace guidance; personal guidance can apply across both.

### Capability shape (opposite of coding agents)

Coding agents: few deep primitives (`read` / `write` / `shell`) + strong model priors for code/FS.

Linear Agent: **many shallow product tools** + **product ontology** + **best-practice fragments**. Each capability needs tools, an explanation of what the data means, and principles for using the feature well — not a thin wrapper over GraphQL/SDK (they deliberately avoided low-level primitives that invite speculative mistakes).

Composition unit: **progressive system skills** — each bundles metadata + prompt fragment + tools. Preload by invocation context (prompt + surface); load more mid-run as the task reveals needs. User skills (personal/team) and **Loops** (scheduled / event triggers) sit on top of that system layer.

### Harness pressures Linear called out

Off-the-shelf harnesses assume prompt+tools upfront → `run` → done. Linear needed mid-run control:
1. **Dynamic tool injection** via skills without blowing the provider **prefix cache**
2. **Contextual mid-run approval** — not only tool-name rules (e.g. delete something just created vs delete an existing issue; post to most threads vs a public-synced thread)
3. **Async sub-agent that looks sync to parent** — parent sees a tool call; underneath, suspend the durable workflow so idle wait does not hold server resources, then resume

Custom stack: provider-agnostic client, durable workflow agent loop, streaming/storage that understands product-rich elements before the UI.

### Permissions + guidance layers

- Act **within the caller's ACL** — only see/change what the invoking user can
- Guidance scoped **workspace / team / personal / surface** (layered instruction resources, not one global system prompt blob)

### June implication (design, not implementation yet)

v0 stays coding-agent shaped. Core blocks must still be able to grow into Linear-shaped product agents without a rewrite:

1. **Progressive skills** — tools + prompt fragments loadable mid-run
2. **Durable pause/resume** + contextual `toolApproval` policy
3. **Multi-client protocol** — same wire, many UIs (already a June goal)
4. **Identity/ACL on every tool host call**
5. **Guidance as layered instruction resources** (workspace / team / personal / surface)
6. **Triggers / wakes** (Loops-shaped: schedule + event)
7. **Tool packs as shallow domain adapters + ontology**, not only FS/shell

Fit with existing June posture: skills/resources already in the Pi-simple harness story; multi-client protocol already locked; tool packs as swappable blocks already named. The stress-test is whether those blocks stay open enough for progressive disclosure, durable mid-run approval, and ACL-scoped product tools — not whether we ship a Linear clone.
